description: "I'm a professional pastry chef and baker. I have worked many restaurants in Ireland and abroad, including Michelin star and 4AA Rosette award winners. I established Uachtar in 2020 with the goal of producing high quality home produce. From traditional brown bread to celebratory cakes, I bake everything in a home kitchen in Co. Kilkenny. You will regularly find me selling at the Carlow Farmer's Market."
